# From heaven He (God) looks down - பரலோகத்திலிருந்து கண்ணோக்குகிறார்

This song of heavenly gaze and hopeful promise echoes Psalm 53 — “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ … God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.” It confronts universal corruption while affirming God’s watchful eye and coming salvation from Zion. In the eternal day, this promise is fulfilled — God dwells with His people, no more fools or corruption, only endless seeking and finding in His presence (Revelation 21:3).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who looks down from heaven and seeks those who seek You,
thank You for Your watchful eye amid a fallen world.
Let us seek You with all our hearts, turn from folly, await Your salvation.
In the eternal day, let us dwell with You in Zion forever.
Come quickly, our True God and Deliverer.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
