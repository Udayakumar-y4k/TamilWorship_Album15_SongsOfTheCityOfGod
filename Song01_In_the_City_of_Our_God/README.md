# In the City of Our God - தேவனின் நகரத்திலே

This song of joyful celebration and meditation echoes Psalm 48 — “Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! … Walk about Zion, go around her; number her towers… This is God, our God forever and ever.” It calls the remnant to behold Zion’s beauty, walk her walls, and praise the great King. In the eternal day, this is fulfilled perfectly — we dwell in the New Jerusalem, the city of the great King, where the Lamb is the light forever (Revelation 21:22–23).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, great King of Zion and our eternal God,
thank You for the city of our God — beautiful, exalted, our joy.
Let us walk her walls in faith, meditate on Your glory.
In the eternal day, let us dwell in Your city forever.
Come quickly, our great King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
