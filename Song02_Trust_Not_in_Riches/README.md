# Trust Not in Riches - செல்வத்தை நம்பாதே

This song of sober warning and eternal perspective echoes Psalm 49 — “Hear this, all peoples! … those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches? … For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.” It reminds us that earthly riches and glory vanish in death, while the city of God endures forever. In the eternal day, this truth is fulfilled — no riches to trust, only the Lamb who is our eternal treasure (Revelation 21:21–23).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, eternal treasure and true riches,
thank You for warning us not to trust in fading wealth.
Let us store up treasure in heaven, fix our eyes on You.
In the eternal day, let us dwell in Your city with no need of riches.
Come quickly, our true Inheritance.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
