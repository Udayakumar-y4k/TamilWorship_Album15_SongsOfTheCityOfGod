# O True God - மெய்தேவனே

This song of contrast and confident trust echoes Psalm 52 — “Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? … The steadfast love of God endures all the day… But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.” It confronts the wicked boaster while affirming the psalmist’s security in God’s enduring mercy. In the eternal day, this trust is perfected — no more boasting evil, only flourishing forever in God’s house with the Lamb (Revelation 22:3–5).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, whose mercy endures forever,
thank You for being our portion and refuge.
Let us trust not in riches but in Your steadfast love.
In the eternal day, let us flourish like olive trees in Your house.
Come quickly, our Enduring Mercy.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
