# Call to Me in Time - ஆபத்துக் காலத்தில்

This song of confident calling and divine promise echoes Psalm 50:15 — “Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.” It is a direct invitation from God to cry out in distress, with His assurance of presence, deliverance, and honor. In the eternal day, this promise is fully realized — no more trouble, only eternal calling and answering in His presence (Revelation 21:3–4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who answers when we call in trouble,
thank You for Your promise to deliver and honor us.
Teach us to call on You in every distress.
In the eternal day, let us glorify You without end.
Come quickly, our Deliverer and Glory.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
